Differential equations course repo

The Mathematica paclet contains a package of utilities used in an introductory differential equations course. Future development may lead to a more general-purpose set of tools.

The current release is intended to make available to students and the instructor a few tools, a stylesheet, and some tutorials on differential equations as they are written.
